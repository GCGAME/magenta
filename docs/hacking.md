# Notes for hacking on Magenta

This file contains a random collection of notes for hacking on Magenta.

## Regenerating syscall support

Syscall support is generated from system/public/magenta/syscalls.sysgen.
Generally we don't want to willy-nilly add syscalls of course.
But if, perchance, you need to regenerate the syscall support files follow
these instructions.

Generally it's best to regenerate the files in a clean client.
That way `git status` will tell you what files have been changed.
Regenerating the files is easy enough:

```
$ scripts/run-sysgen.sh
```

## Terminal navigation and keyboard shortcuts

* Alt+Tab switches between VTs
* Alt+F{1,2,...} switches directly to a VT
* Alt+Up/Down scrolls up and down by lines
* Shift+PgUp/PgDown scrolls up and down by half page
* Ctrl+Alt+Delete reboots

## Low level kernel development

For kernel development it's not uncommon to need to monitor or break things
before the gfxconsole comes up.

To enable the early console before the graphical console comes up use the
``gfxconsole.early`` cmdline option. More information can be found in
[kernel_cmdline.md](kernel_cmdline.md).
Enabling ``startup.keep-log-visible``will ensure that the kernel log stays
visible if the gfxconsole comes up after boot. To disable the gfxconsole
entirely you can disable the video driver it is binding to via ``driver.<driver
name>.disable``.
On a skylake system, all these options together would look something like:

```
$ tools/build-magenta-x86_64/bootserver build-magenta-x86_64/magenta.bin -- gfxconsole.early driver.intel-i915-display.disable
```

To directly output to the console rather than buffering it (useful in the event
of kernel freezes) you can enable ``ENABLE_KERNEL_LL_DEBUG`` in your ``local.mk`` like so:

```
EXTERNAL_KERNEL_DEFINES := ENABLE_KERNEL_LL_DEBUG=1
```

More information on ``local.mk`` can be found via ``make help``

## Bootloader Configuration

gigaboot20x6 supports additional parameters that can be set via including them in
a file called ``cmdline`` in the root if the partition gigaboot20x6 inhabits. Presently,
all options take integer values.

* ``smp.maxcpus`` The max number of CPUs for magenta to utilize.
* ``bootloader.timeout`` How many seconds to wait at the gigaboot boot menu.
* ``ktrace.bufsize`` How many MB to allocate for ktrace buffers.
* ``ktrace.grpmask`` The group mask to use for trace entry filtering.

e.g.
```
bootloader.timeout=0
```

## Requesting a backtrace from within a program

For debugging purposes, the system crashlogger can print backtraces by
request. It requires modifying your source, but in the absence of a
debugger, or as a general builtin debug mechanism, this can be useful.

```
#include <magenta/crashlogger.h>

void my_function() {
  crashlogger_request_backtrace();
}
```

When crashlogger\_request\_backtrace is called, it causes an
exception used by debuggers for breakpoint handling.
If a debugger is not attached, the system crashlogger will
process the exception, print a backtrace, and then resume the thread.
